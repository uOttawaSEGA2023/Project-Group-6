# Project Description
In this project, you will implement the **Healthcare Appointment Management System (HAMS)** for a telehealth clinic. HAMS is a mobile application designed to streamline the process of healthcare appointment scheduling and management. The app support three types of users: **Patient**, **Doctor**, and **Administrator**.

The **Patient** views available appointment slots so that they may book or cancel appointments. **Patients** can also rate doctors.

The **Doctor** manages their schedules and responds to appointment requests.

The **Administrator** approves the account registration requests of doctors and patients.

In the next sections, we will describe the application in detail from the perspective of each user.

## Patient
To become a **Patient**, a user submits a registration request that must be approved by the **Administrator**.
Once registered, a **Patient** can:
• View their upcoming appointments.
• Cancel an existing appointment.
• View their past appointments.
• Rate a Doctor following an appointment.
• Book an appointment.

## Doctor
To become a **Doctor**, a user submits a registration request that must be approved by the **Administrator**.
Once registered, a **Doctor** can:
• Specify and change the shifts they would like to work.
• View their upcoming appointments.
• View their past appointments.
• Cancel appointments.
• Approve appointment requests.
The **Doctor** may also elect to approve all appointment requests. This way they do not have to approve individual requests. Requests are simply approved automatically.

## Administrator
The **Administrator** is a pre-registered user. This means that the **Administrator’s** account information (i.e., username and password) are already in the database when the system is first launched. The **Administrator** can approve or reject registration requests from **Patients** and **Doctors**.
